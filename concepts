what is a blockchain? -> an immutable, distributed ledger.

Ledger: a collection of financial transactions. 

- immutable: once a transaction is recorded can't be undone.
- distributed: not controled by a single entity.

NONCE: proof of work method

TRANSACTIONS: Confirmed only when a new block is mined (they are validated)

proof of work: number of 0s for the hash calculation. 

HASH CALCULATION: INCREASE NONCE UNTIL PROOF OF WORK MATCHES
